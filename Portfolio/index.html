<h2> Why i was interested in joining Code Nation </h2>
<p1> I have always been interested in programming and software development but until recently i have been unable to find a way to kickstart a career in the industry, that was until I was informed about 
    Code Nation. After reading their website and sylabus, I realised that this is the perfect learning envrionment and course for me.

<h2> Targets and goals</h2>
<h3> Improve my problem solving skills </h3>
<p1> I feel that i am gaining progress pretty quickly especially whilst paricipating in the code nation course as I am doing a lot of research based activities</p1>
<h3>Learn and develop games development</h3>
<p1> Although I have not directly started to learn games development, I feel that the skills I am learning during the course will be a big advancement for when I start to look at games dev
